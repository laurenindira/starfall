# starfall

## description
In another world, stars power the universe: from the cars, to the ships, to the electricity in your house. Forget solar or gas, star power is where it's at. However, these stars need to be collected, or well, caught. Star Catchers are specialists in the field, but there's a catch -- falling stars can only be found on the most unstable planets, where meteors make regular appearances. Play as Lumina, a Star Catcher on a chaotic planet, to collect as many stars as possible and avoid meteors along the way.
